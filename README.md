# VisualBeltShenanigans

This is a Windows Forms Application to help you create perfectly balanced belts, or split specific amounts of resources off of a belt.

To use, first click `Create Scenario`, and after you have created a scenario, select a graph algorithm from the list, and select `Generate Graph`

To install, go to the releases tab, download the Application Files zip folder, and run setup application in the folder.
You can also download the source code and compile it yourself if you want.
